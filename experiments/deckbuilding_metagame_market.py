one negative consequence of this is that analogous/interchangeable units will have significant downward pressure on their costs. This could perhaps be mitigated by coming up with a metric of interchangeability (how likely are these cards to be used with the same other cards) and distributing the weighted cost between them by an additional proportion.

if you can only find points with the same sign of force
