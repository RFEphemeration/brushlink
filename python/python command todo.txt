string literals
	delimeters?
	printf / templating?
comments #
skips | or _ perhaps

named arguments

# valid next argument

pure / impure functions
	pure functions can only call other pure functions
	set local isn't really pure, but doesn't break purity...

const values

aliased functions and types

define types

more complex types

subtypes

# load modules, share loaded modules?

# lambda element
# unevaluated element - this is quote, done

keyword parameters and elements for syntactic sugar: (if) else - or are these do-able with named arguments? [] for list construction...


overloading
	would allow things like shared name for type literal and constructor function
	ambiguous placeholders and resolution might be a little tricky to implement
	ambiguity might last for more than one more input, requiring nested ambiguities
		could generate warnings/errors if this is the case and require resolution, at least to start

infix operators

save/load state of program
